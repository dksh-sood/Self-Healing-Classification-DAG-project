This movie was absolutely amazing and I loved every minute of it!
The film was terrible, boring, and a complete waste of time.
I think this movie was okay, nothing special but not bad either.
What an incredible performance by the lead actor, truly outstanding!
The plot was confusing and the ending made no sense at all.
A masterpiece of cinema with brilliant direction and cinematography.
I fell asleep halfway through, it was so dull and uninteresting.
The special effects were good but the story lacked depth.
One of the best movies I've seen this year, highly recommended!
The acting was poor and the dialogue felt forced and unnatural.
